Hi there! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Datta Lab](http://datta.hms.harvard.edu/) in the Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School. I completed my PhD in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the University of Rochester with [Greg DeAngelis](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/people/faculty/deangelis_greg/index.html), during which I studied how the primate visual system infers 3D scene structure (e.g., motion and depth) during active movements using electrophysiology, psychophysics, and computational models. Before that, I designed wood drilling machines as a Mechanical Engineering major in college. 

I am interested in the neural mechanisms through which animals coordinate behavior and interact with natural environments. 

Besides science, I enjoy swimming, photography, reading, cooking, hiking, and traveling.
